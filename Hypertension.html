    <h1>Hypertension and its insidious effects on African Americans: no time to be silent</h1>
    <p class="history">Hypertension, aka "the silent killer", is a dangerous condition of high blood pressure that can permanently damage the heart and kidneys, resulting in higher risk of <span>stroke, kidney failure, myocardial infarction, and death</span>. While values have changed over time, the normal indicator is a baseline of blood pressure measurement of 140/90. Often, hypertension is asymptomatic, but speak to your doctor immediately if you begin exhibiting certain systems, such as</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="symptoms">Dizziness</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How has hypertension adversely impacted African Americans?</h2>
    <p class="demographic">Unfortunately, people of African descent are disproportionately impacted by hypertension, often developing it at earlier ages than Caucasians. Other risk factors prevalent among those of African descent include obesity, family history of disease, and poor diet. Socioeconomic factors such as poverty, low-income wages, limited access to exercise or outdoor spaces, and a lack of healthy food options only serve to compound these factors. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/aa_sourcebook.htm" target="_blank" class="cdc"> Click here for CDC information </a></p>
